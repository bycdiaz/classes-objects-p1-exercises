# Create a class called MyCar. When you initialize a new instance or object of the class, 
# allow the user to define some instance variables that tell us the year, color, and 
# model of the car. Create an instance variable that is set to 0 during instantiation 
# of the object to track the current speed of the car as well. Create instance methods 
# that allow the car to speed up, brake, and shut the car off.

# Add an accessor method to your MyCar class to change and view the color of your car. 
# Then add an accessor method that allows you to view, but not modify, the year of your car.

# You want to create a nice interface that allows you to accurately describe the action you 
# want your program to perform. Create a method called spray_paint that can be called on an 
# object and will modify the color of the car.
